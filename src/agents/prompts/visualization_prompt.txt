Create a hierarchical JSON structure to visualize the key concepts of this research paper as a Mind Map.

Paper Title: {title}
Abstract: {abstract}

Structure Guidelines:
- Root Node: Paper Title (Shortened if >10 words)
- Level 1 Branches: Core Problem, Key Innovation, Methodology, Main Results
- Level 2 Branches: Specific, actionable details (NOT generic text).

CONSTRAINTS:
- **MAX 7 WORDS per node**. Keep labels punchy and concise.

        {{
            "id": "node_problem",
            "label": "Core Problem",
            "children": [ ... ]
        }},
