To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation. Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin. Code, data and models will be publicly available.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2512.07186.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"666f2534a119281ee0e39783","avatarUrl":"/avatars/1de737da5cdf68d9bb1f98db8d5ad8b9.svg","fullname":"Zhuoming Liu","name":"zhuomingliu","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":1},"organization":{"_id":"674e3f226f1597e933139875","name":"amazon-agi","fullname":"Amazon AGI","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6163872970554df7422ef784/DZhaUsJ9C5C2G6vHKUzLD.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2512.12730","authors":[{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803e5","name":"Jingzhe Ding","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803e6","name":"Shengda Long","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803e7","name":"Changxin Pu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803e8","name":"Huan Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803e9","name":"Hongwan Gao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803ea","name":"Xiang Gao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803eb","name":"Chao He","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803ec","name":"Yue Hou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803ed","name":"Fei Hu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803ee","name":"Zhaojian Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803ef","name":"Weiran Shi","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f0","name":"Zaiyuan Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f1","name":"Daoguang Zan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f2","name":"Chenchen Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f3","name":"Xiaoxu Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f4","name":"Qizhi Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f5","name":"Xianfu Cheng","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f6","name":"Bo Deng","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f7","name":"Qingshui Gu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f8","name":"Kai Hua","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803f9","name":"Juntao Lin","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803fa","name":"Pai Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803fb","name":"Mingchen Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803fc","name":"Xuanguang Pan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803fd","name":"Zifan Peng","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803fe","name":"Yujia Qin","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a117803ff","name":"Yong Shan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780400","name":"Zhewen Tan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780401","name":"Weihao Xie","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780402","name":"Zihan Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780403","name":"Yishuo Yuan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780404","name":"Jiayu Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780405","name":"Enduo Zhao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780406","name":"Yunfei Zhao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780407","name":"He Zhu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780408","name":"Chenyang Zou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780409","name":"Ming Ding","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a1178040a","name":"Jianpeng Jiao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a1178040b","name":"Jiaheng Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a1178040c","name":"Minghao Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a1178040d","name":"Qian Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a1178040e","name":"Chongyao Tao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a1178040f","name":"Jian Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780410","name":"Tong Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780411","name":"Zhaoxiang Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780412","name":"Xinjie Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780413","name":"Wenhao Huang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6940cff365f1e24a11780414","name":"Ge Zhang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2025-12-14T15:12:13.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-12-16T00:51:09.038Z","title":"NL2Repo-Bench: Towards Long-Horizon Repository Generation Evaluation of Coding Agents","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"638efcf4c67af472d316d424","avatarUrl":"/avatars/97a57859d7d87a3a8f1bb41d32a72bc2.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ge Zhang","user":"zhangysk","type":"user"},"summary":"Recent advances in coding agents suggest rapid progress toward autonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems.
